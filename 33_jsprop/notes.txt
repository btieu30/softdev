Bubble phase: The events are triggered in order from the "youngest" (html tag related) event in the tree to the "oldest".
Capture phase: The events are triggered in order from the "oldest" (html tag related) event in the tree to the "youngest".

Setting the boolean to true in addEventListener will stop events from activating in the bubble phase, so they activate in the
capture phase instead. Table -> row -> cell order.

Setting the boolean false (which is the default) in addEventListener will stop events from activating in the capture phase, so
they activate in the bubble phase instead. Cell -> row -> table order.
